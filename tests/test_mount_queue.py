"""The gate that lets widgets start -- and every way it must not jam.

``apps/web/mount_queue.js`` holds every widget on a page until after the first
paint, then starts them one at a time. That makes it the one piece of front-end
code whose failure is total: a gate that never opens leaves the reader looking at
"warming up" forever, with no error and nothing to click. The widgets themselves
would still pass all their own tests, because they are simply never called.

It cannot be checked in a driven browser either -- that tab is always hidden, so
it never paints, never fires requestAnimationFrame and never delivers an
IntersectionObserver callback. Finding that out is *how* the hidden-document case
below came to be written in photonn: the first version of the scheduler waited on
a paint signal alone and stranded every widget on a page opened in a background
tab.

So it is exercised under Node against a stand-in for the parts of the DOM it
touches, with time, paint and scrolling driven by hand. Runner and assertions are
both ported from photonn; see ``tests/mount_queue_runner.js``.
