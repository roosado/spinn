"""The shared canvas primitives, tested once instead of nine times not at all.

``apps/web/plot.js`` is inherited from photonn, where it holds what nine widgets
each carried a private copy of: the device-pixel-ratio clamp, the guarded canvas
resize, the width observer, the theme observer, the palette read, the colour
ramps and the scalar-field rasteriser.

The assertions are ported from photonn's ``tests/test_plot.py`` along with the
runner, because they are the record of *which bugs the private copies had*. The
resize guard is the headline: ``canvas.width = w`` throws the backing store away
and allocates a new one even when the value is unchanged, which is why the one
widget on that site which animates was reallocating a ~1440x860 surface every
orbit frame. The theme observer is the other: the site's toggle writes
``data-theme`` on the root and never touches the OS preference, so a widget
listening only on ``matchMedia`` never hears it.

This repo has no widgets yet. The file is proven here anyway because plan 01's
job is to establish what the inheritance actually does, and because a primitive
that is wrong now is wrong silently later.
