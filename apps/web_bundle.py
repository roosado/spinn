"""Encoding shared by every browser weight bundle.

Two exporters write bundles that ``apps/web/d2nn.js:buildNet`` decodes:
:mod:`apps.export_d2nn_web` (a trained model with a full Phase-2 handoff) and
:mod:`apps.export_sweep_web` (a configuration lifted out of the optics sweep).
Both have to agree with that decoder byte for byte, so the encoding lives here
once rather than being written out twice and drifting.

The 8-bit path is not a size shortcut. ``docs/tolerance_d2nn.md`` measures this
design as holding accuracy down to **3-bit** phase control, and 8 bits is what a
real SLM offers, so the quantised model is the *more* faithful one. That it is
also four times smaller is what lets two trained models share a page.
