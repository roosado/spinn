/*
 * mount_queue.js -- when the widgets on a page are allowed to start.
 *
 * Every widget on this site mounts itself, and used to do so from one shared
 * DOMContentLoaded handler. On the optics page that meant the browser parsed two
 * megabytes of inline script and then, in a single uninterrupted task, decoded a
 * 56-mask model, ran it, ran it again for the 3D stage, and built ~60 offscreen
 * canvases -- before the first pixel of prose was on screen. On a laptop that is
 * an unpleasant half second. On a phone it is long enough that the tab is judged
 * unresponsive and reloaded, which is why the page could appear to never load.
 *
 * Nothing here makes a widget cheaper or less interactive. It changes *when* the
 * cost is paid:
 *
 *   1. Nothing runs until the first paint has happened, so the page is readable
 *      immediately and the reader has something to look at while the machines
 *      warm up.
 *   2. Widgets start one at a time, in document order -- read off the DOM, not
 *      taken from the order the mount calls happen to run in -- with a yield
 *      between them. The main thread is never held for more than one widget's
 *      mount, so the page keeps responding to scrolls and taps throughout.
 *   3. A widget far below the fold waits until the reader is approaching it. It
 *      still starts by itself -- no tap, no button, nothing to discover -- just
 *      not while it is a screen and a half away.
 *
 * There is deliberately no small-screen fallback and no "tap to activate": a
 * phone gets the same working machines a laptop does, only sequenced so the
 * device can survive delivering them.
 *
 * Usage:  window.SpinnMount('containerId', function (el) { ... }, opts);
 * opts (all optional):
 *   defer  -- wait until the element is near the viewport before mounting.
 *
 * Standalone demo pages do not include this file, so every generated mount falls
 * back to a plain DOMContentLoaded when window.SpinnMount is absent.
