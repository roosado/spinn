"""The standalone page a single widget is previewed on.

Each widget in ``apps/web`` has a demo module that writes one self-contained HTML
file so the widget can be opened on its own, away from the site. Those modules
carried five copies of the same shell: a ``_PAGE`` template, a ``build_html``, a
``save_demo`` and a ``main``, about 150 lines, with the CSS character-identical
in all five. What actually differed per module was a title, a heading, a
standfirst, one or two container divs, and sometimes a closing note.

So that is what this takes. The demo modules keep the part ``build_site`` imports
from them -- their ``*_bundle`` and ``*_mount`` pair -- and describe the page in
six strings.

Deliberately *not* shared with :func:`apps.build_site._document`. The site's
shell carries a topbar, a theme toggle, an in-page index, a hand-off card and a
footer, and its stylesheet is 260 lines; a preview page is a heading and a widget.
They are different chrome, and merging them would mean one of the two carrying
the other's baggage.
